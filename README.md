# **Uncovering Profitability: A Power BI Case Study**

This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow—from raw data extraction to a comprehensive Power BI dashboard—aimed at uncovering true profitability and providing actionable business insights.

---

## **Project Summary**

The primary goal was to move beyond a simplistic hourly billing model and reveal the business’s true profitability. By building a robust data model and challenging initial assumptions, this project provided executive-level insights for data-driven decision-making.

---

## **Key Features & Business Insights**

### **1. Executive Summary**
- **Strong Profitability:** Analysis revealed robust profitability, with the business achieving **$724K in profit** from a total revenue of **$1.07M**.
- **Critical Client Losses:** A small number of clients are driving significant losses. **BookNook (-$149K)** and **ecofi (-$134K)** were identified as major sources of these losses, highlighting an urgent need for client portfolio review.
- **Top Performance Drivers:** Top-performing employees, led by **Axel Chaves ($557K profit)**, are key contributors to company profitability.

### **2. Workforce Insights**
- **Critical Data Anomalies:** Significant data discrepancies were uncovered. For example, **Jorge Ramirez** was associated with a negative profit of **-$30,839** despite only 1 hour being recorded. This anomaly prompted further data validation.
- **Geographic Cost Concentration:** Payroll costs are not evenly distributed. **Costa Rica ($193K)** and **Argentina ($54K)** account for a disproportionate share of total payroll.

### **3. Finance Deep Dive**
- **Business Model Incongruity:** Analysis showed a lack of direct correlation between revenue and hours, refuting the traditional hourly-rate model and validating the use of **profit** as the primary performance metric.
- **Non-Profitable Projects:** Certain services and clients (e.g., **Audaces, -$31K loss**) were identified as operating at a loss—crucial for project portfolio management and future risk mitigation.

## **Technical Skills Demonstrated**

- **Data Extraction & ETL:** Raw Excel data was extracted, transformed, and loaded into a SQL database, demonstrating proficiency in building scalable data pipelines.
- **Data Modeling:** Built a robust data model in Power BI connecting key tables (e.g., `INVOICE_CUSTOMER`, `INVOICE_EMPLOYEE`) for accurate analysis.
- **DAX:** Developed custom DAX measures and calculated columns for precise business metrics (e.g., Profit, Total Revenue).
- **Power Query:** Utilized Power Query for advanced data cleaning and transformation, ensuring high data quality.
- **Data Visualization:** Designed interactive, business-centric dashboards in Power BI for clear, actionable communication of findings.
