## Why Hire Me?

As a data analyst, I bridge the gap between complex data and business action. I pinpoint profit opportunities, flag risks, and deliver insights executives use to make smarter, faster decisions. My work transforms “just data” into real business impact—every time.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a rigorous, end-to-end analytics workflow—from raw Excel exports to polished, interactive Power BI dashboards. My analysis surfaced the company’s true profitability, challenged legacy KPIs, and equipped leadership with actionable, C-level recommendations.

**Outcome:**
- Identified $724K profit from $1.07M revenue
- Pinpointed $283K in avoidable client losses
- Delivered clear, data-backed recommendations for portfolio review

---

## Methodology & Phases

### 1. Data Engineering & Cleaning (ETL)
- **Extraction & Loading:** Raw Excel data → SQL database
- **Date Normalization:** Converted NVARCHAR dates to DATE (`TRY_CAST(TRIM(...))`) for reliable time-series analytics
- **Anomaly Resolution:**  
  - Systematic removal of legacy “phantom” employee ID (005Un000002ZnXnIAK) across 4 tables
  - Imputed missing service type and country fields, flagged for audit

### 2. Data Modeling & Validation
- **Star Schema Design:** Linked INVOICE_CUSTOMER, INVOICE_EMPLOYEE, TIME_ENTRIES in Power BI for robust, scalable analysis
- **Custom Metrics:** Built DAX measures for unseen metrics (Profit, Total Revenue)
- **Assumption Testing:** Exploratory analysis disproved revenue-hour correlation; profit redefined as true KPI

### 3. Strategic Storytelling & Visualization
- **Executive Dashboard Flow:** High-level summary → granular workforce & financial drilldowns
- **Actionable Insights:** Highlighted loss-driving clients (BookNook, ecofi) and projects (Audaces), with recommendations
- **Transparent Anomaly Reporting:** Surfaced issues (e.g., Jorge Ramirez’s –$30,839 profit) for business action
