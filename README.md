## Why Hire Me?

As a data analyst, I bridge the gap between complex data and business action. I pinpoint profit opportunities, flag risks, and deliver insights executives use to make smarter, faster decisions. My work transforms ‚Äújust data‚Äù into real business impact‚Äîevery time.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a rigorous, end-to-end analytics workflow‚Äîfrom raw Excel exports to polished, interactive Power BI dashboards. My analysis surfaced the company‚Äôs true profitability, challenged legacy KPIs, and equipped leadership with actionable, C-level recommendations.

**Outcome:**
- Identified $724K profit from $1.07M revenue
- Pinpointed $283K in avoidable client losses
- Delivered clear, data-backed recommendations for portfolio review

---

## Methodology & Phases

### 1. Data Engineering & Cleaning (ETL)
- **Extraction & Loading:** Raw Excel data ‚Üí SQL database
- **Date Normalization:** Converted NVARCHAR dates to DATE (`TRY_CAST(TRIM(...))`) for reliable time-series analytics
- **Anomaly Resolution:**  
  - Systematic removal of legacy ‚Äúphantom‚Äù employee ID (005Un000002ZnXnIAK) across 4 tables
  - Imputed missing service type and country fields, flagged for audit

### 2. Data Modeling & Validation
- **Star Schema Design:** Linked INVOICE_CUSTOMER, INVOICE_EMPLOYEE, TIME_ENTRIES in Power BI for robust, scalable analysis
- **Custom Metrics:** Built DAX measures for unseen metrics (Profit, Total Revenue)
- **Assumption Testing:** Exploratory analysis disproved revenue-hour correlation; profit redefined as true KPI

### 3. Strategic Storytelling & Visualization
- **Executive Dashboard Flow:** High-level summary ‚Üí granular workforce & financial drilldowns
- **Actionable Insights:** Highlighted loss-driving clients (BookNook, ecofi) and projects (Audaces), with recommendations
- **Transparent Anomaly Reporting:** Surfaced issues (e.g., Jorge Ramirez‚Äôs ‚Äì$30,839 profit) for business action

---

## Key Insights & Results

- **Strong Profitability:**  
  - **$724K** in profit  
  - **$1.07M** in total revenue
- **Client Losses:**  
  - BookNook (**‚Äì$149K**)  
  - ecofi (**‚Äì$134K**)
- **Top Performer:**  
  - Axel Chaves (**$557K** profit)
- **Anomaly Detection:**  
  - Jorge Ramirez logged **‚Äì$30,839** profit for 1 hour‚Äîflagged for review
- **Payroll Hotspots:**  
  - Costa Rica (**$193K**) and Argentina (**$54K**)
- **Business Model Shift:**  
  - Profit, not hours, is the decisive metric for performance

## Technical Implementation Examples

### 1. SQL for Data Cleaning & Aggregation

This query joins time entry data with customer data to audit unassigned labor costs, ensuring no relevant data is ignored:

```sql
-- Join time entries with client info to audit unassigned labor costs
SELECT
    TE.employee_id,
    TE.time_worked,
    IC.client_name,
    -- Use CASE to flag unassigned efforts
    CASE
        WHEN IC.client_name IS NULL THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è  Unassigned client effort'
        ELSE '‚úì Assigned to client'
    END AS audit_flag
FROM
    dbo.TIME_ENTRIES AS TE
LEFT JOIN
    dbo.INVOICE_CUSTOMER AS IC
ON
    TE.customer_id = IC.customer_id;
```

---

### 2. DAX for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

This DAX measure defines Profit, enabling precise business analysis beyond raw transactional data:

```DAX
Profit = 
VAR TotalRevenue = SUM('INVOICE_CUSTOMER'[INVOICE_AMOUNT])
VAR TotalPayroll = SUM('INVOICE_EMPLOYEE'[PAYROLL_COST])
RETURN
    TotalRevenue - TotalPayroll
```

---

### 3. Power Query (M Language) for Data Transformation

A key transformation step to standardize date formats for reliable time-series analysis:

```m
let
    Source = Csv.Document(...),
    #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Source,{
        {"Date", type datetime},
        {"Employee ID", type text}
        // ... other columns
    }),
    #"Standardized Dates" = Table.TransformColumns(
        #"Changed Type", {{"Date", DateTime.Date}}
    )
in
    #"Standardized Dates"
```
