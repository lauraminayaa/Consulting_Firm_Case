Uncovering Profitability: A Power BI Case Study
This project provides a complete data analysis workflow, from raw data extraction to a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, with the goal of uncovering true profitability and providing actionable insights to senior management.

Project Summary
The primary goal was to move beyond a simplistic hourly billing model to uncover the business's true profitability. Through a robust data model and challenging initial assumptions, this project provided key insights into revenue, costs, and workforce performance, enabling strategic decision-making.

Key Features & Business Insights
1. Executive Summary
Strong Profitability: Analysis revealed strong profitability, with the business achieving $724K in Profit from a total revenue of $1.07M.

Critical Client Losses: A small number of clients are driving significant losses. BookNook (-$149K) and ecofi (-$134K) were identified as major sources of these losses, highlighting an urgent need for contract review.

Top Performance Drivers: Top-performing employees, led by Axel Chaves ($557K profit), are key contributors to the company's profitability.

2. Workforce Insights
Critical Data Anomalies: The analysis revealed significant data discrepancies. Jorge Ramirez, for instance, was associated with a negative profit of -$30,839 despite only 1 hour being recorded. This anomaly, along with similar cases like Matheus Ferreira, highlights the need to investigate potential data entry issues or non-standard project contracts to ensure data integrity.

Geographic Cost Concentration: Payroll costs are not evenly distributed. The two countries with the highest payroll, Costa Rica ($193K) and Argentina ($54K), account for a disproportionate share of the total payroll, indicating opportunities for optimizing resource allocation.

3. Finance Deep Dive
Business Model Incongruity: A key finding was the lack of direct correlation between Revenue and Hours. This refutes a traditional hourly-rate model and validates the use of Profit as the main performance metric.

Non-Profitable Projects: Specific services and clients, such as Audaces, were found to be operating at a loss of -$31K. This insight is crucial for managing project portfolios and preventing future financial losses.

Technical Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases a complete data analysis skill set, from backend data management to frontend visualization.

The raw data from Excel was extracted, transformed, and loaded into a SQL database. This process demonstrates proficiency in building a scalable data pipeline and preparing source data for robust analysis.

Data Modeling: A robust data model was built in Power BI to connect and relate key tables (INVOICE_CUSTOMER, INVOICE_EMPLOYEE, etc.), ensuring accurate and reliable calculations.
DAX was utilized to build a suite of custom measures and calculated columns, enabling a precise analysis of key business metrics such as Profit and Total Revenue that were not available in the raw data.

Power Query: Power Query was used for advanced data cleaning, transformation, and shaping to ensure data quality and integrity before being loaded into the data model.

Data Visualization: Interactive and business-centric dashboards were designed and developed in Power BI to communicate complex findings clearly and concisely.

Dashboard Preview
Here are screenshots of the final Power BI dashboards.

Executive Summary
This dashboard provides a high-level overview of key financial metrics like Profit, Revenue, and Payroll Cost, along with a summary of top-performing employees and a list of clients driving losses.

Workforce Insights
This dashboard focuses on workforce performance and cost optimization, featuring a timeline of Payroll Cost versus Hours and a detailed table of employee data anomalies.

Finance Deep Dive
This dashboard presents a detailed financial analysis, including the critical scatter plot showing the lack of correlation between revenue and hours, and a table identifying non-profitable projects and services.

Conclusion & Learnings
This project underscores the importance of critical thinking and data validation. By refuting the initial hourly-rate assumption, the analysis provided a clear narrative of the business's true financial health, enabling more accurate and impactful recommendations.
